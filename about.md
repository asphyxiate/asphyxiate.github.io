<p>
Duane spent ten long, gruelling years climbing the corporate ladder in the IT industry. He was good at what he did. <b><i>Damn</i></b> good. He had great communication skills and interfaced well with people. He got results for both clients and colleagues alike. 
</p>
<p>
But it just wasn’t enough. He wasn’t satisfied. He wasn’t happy. Something was missing. Something creative. It was to be a realisation that would alter the course of his life.
</p>
<p>
With a newfound joy kindled in his heart and a willingness to subsist on little more than cup noodles and coffee for the next few years Duane turned his back on a life of opulence and success and dived headfirst into a Bachelor of Animation at Griffith University. Animation, 3D modelling and entertainment had been his passions for as long as he could remember. What greater challenge could there be than proving himself in this arena! 
</p>
<p>
With honed skills in character and environmental modelling and a knack for 3D animation, Duane now looks forward to bringing together both old and new skillsets to help others realise their own dreams and make the power of imagination tangible!
